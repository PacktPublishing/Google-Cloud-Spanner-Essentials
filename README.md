## About the Video Course
Google Cloud Spanner is another solution for developers and organizations who have hit the limits of traditional relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and others. If you're a developer who would like to have accurate, consistent and real time global data for making decisions, avoid inconsistencies that lead to monetary loss, then this course is for you.

Do you want to resolve consistency and scalability issues and get accurate real-time global data for making decisions? Cloud Spanner makes this possible by creating a global, consistent and a single-source-of-truth data store for your business.

This course will cover the fundamentals of Cloud Spanner and setting it up step by step for operational database workloads by efficiently loading and querying relational data. It also covers modeling tables, indexes and tools with security permissions for best performance in Cloud Spanner. 

By the end of this course, users will have a hands-on exposure to use spanner to setup and use their operational databases to utilize the efficiency of cloud.
